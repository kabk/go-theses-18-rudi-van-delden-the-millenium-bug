The 16th of September 1999 the first episode of the Dutch reality-TV program Big Brother  aired. The concept was extremely successful and all around the world Big Brother houses started to pop up, reality-TV became an inevitable part of my reality. Reality-TV, the vulgar niece of cinema verité, made her first appearance in 1971. What distinguished Reality-TV from cinema verité was that the people portrayed did not have any significant talent or any particular lifestyle, their most important property was their ability to act real. Fame became an interchangeable commodity available broad audience. In 1971 the PBS broadcasted the first reality TV series An American Family its spoken introduction by producer Graig Gilbert is important for understanding the origin of the millennial’s alienation from reality. It raises important questions about the realness of a life lived under surveillance.
<br>
<br>
This is the setting for our series. The series is about the William C. Louds family of Santa Barbara California. For seven months, from May 30th 1971 from January first 1972 the family was filmed as they went about their daily routine. There is no question that the presence of our camera crews and their equipment had an effect on the Louds. One that is impossible to evaluate. It is equally true that the Louds had an effect on us, the filmmakers, for this was a cooperative venture in every sense of the word. The Louds are neither average nor typical. No family is. They are not the American family, but they are an American family. 
<br>
<br>
The passive onlookers, formerly staring at some glamorous presumably unreachable dream, were now looking at the reflection of their own potential stardom in the screen. Enthusiastically the viewer took the stage and signed for a labor of 24/7 self-management, you don’t keep your audience waiting.

<br>
On the 16th of September 1999 twelve individuals and some chickens got locked up in the Big Brother house and garden in Almere. On the 30th of December 1999 Bart Spring in ‘t Veld earned 250.000 florins by exposing himself for 24 hours for 106 days. Eight years later Bart spoke about his experience and his distaste over celebrity culture in The Times.

With no time or energy to spare efficiency always comes before creativity, trapped in what Max Weber termed the iron cage. Stuck in systems based purely on teleological efficiency, the millennial will only he will risk exploration in extreme situations. Desmond Morris speaks of two types of exploration, panic exploration and security exploration. Experiments with chimpanzees have shown that their exploratory potential can easily be encouraged but they seem to prefer a scraping by existence, not too difficult, not too easy. Continues habitation of cyberspace makes the millennial oblivious for the fragility and transience of actual living things. Occupied with the management of a self which high maintenance leaves room only for a scraping by existence, the millennial tries to cheat life like he used to cheat Age of Empires hitting ‘REVEAL MAP’ to avoid wasting time on external exploration.

Both Crawford and Debord describe a fondness of bodiless experiences as a symptom of generalized autism , a natural preference for a reality that is manipulative, controllable, adventurous, exclusively visually and consequenceless. Generalized autism is as state very similar to the experience of dreaming, liberated from the obstructiveness of the body we experience our most lively and outrageous moments. Escaping the hectic of daily life is a motivation often used to excuse binge watching series or game addictions, sleep serves the same purpose as its virtual equivalent, a temporary escape from linearity.

The potential of the Internet as a global democratic and egalitarian platform is starting to be questioned now that it is showing its decidedly non-revolutionary deployment. In Reality TV, The Work of Being Watched. Mark Andrejevic describes this as “The portrayal of surveillance as a form of self-empowerment by the promoters of the online economy.”  In 24/7 Jonathan Cracy suggest the future being so close at hand that it is only imaginable by continuity with the striving for individual gain or survival in the shallowest of presents.  If the millennial is unable to establish intimate relationships with the images that surround him, none of the images becomes familiar enough to constitute merely the background of his life. Eventually the millennial will live in a reality in which time has become cyclic, a true consumer society driven by a process in whose every recurring cycles things appear and disappear.   In a world in which things will be as quickly devoured and discarded as they have appeared an establishment of shared recognition, common interests or goals is damned, community plays only a regressive part in an economy of desire. His dependence on quasi-autonomous products forces the millennial into an endless sequence of open-ended tasks and routines.
